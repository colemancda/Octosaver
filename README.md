# Octosaver

![Screenshot](https://raw.github.com/kimar/Octosaver/master/Release/Screenshot.png)

A simple Screensaver which uses the [Octodex' Octocats](http://octodex.github.com) and shows them (incl. their Names) on your Screen.

Nothing too fancy, but cool though.

Grab the current [Release here](https://github.com/kimar/Octosaver/raw/master/Release/Octosaver.saver.zip)!
And feel free to fork and contribute ;-)
